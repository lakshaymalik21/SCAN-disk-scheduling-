# SCAN-disk-scheduling-
C program to solve the following problem: Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIF order, is: 86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130 starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders)that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the SCAN disk-scheduling algorithms?
